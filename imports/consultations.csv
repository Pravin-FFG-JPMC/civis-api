 The plan says it’s goals are to:
 
 * Have 1/3rd of India’s total land as forests
 
 * Have 2/3rd of India’s mountain lands as forests to reduce soil erosion.
 
 * It aims to increase protected areas (take a look at what a protected area is in the resources)
 
 * Not allow people to use forests for any other purpose
 
 * Plant more trees in cities and along farms
 
 * Use forest land to improve the quality of water
 
 * Manage our forests better to reduce emissions and meet India’s targets (India is a part of a few international agreements to reduce climate change, the forest policy says we will manage our forests better to reduce emissions and meet India’s targets.)
 
 * Use our forests without causing too much damage
 
 * Set guidelines that monitor and check our progress on these goals
 
 Foundations:
 
 While the plan talks about preserving the forest, it also mentions that our forests should be used more and have a higher output. Here are some of the foundations the plan is based on:
 
 * The plan says our forests will be managed to ensure that they provide products, purify the air and water quality and provide recreation, but it doesn’t say how this will happen.
 
 * It says it will manage the sale of forest produce - other than wood, to make these products more profitable for people living in the forest.
 
 * It will provide gas connections to people living in the forest, so that they don’t need to use wood.
 
 Achievement of Goals:
 
 * The plan says it will plant trees that make profits, like timber in the forests and on land that is not productive because of human damage.
 
 * It says it will partner with private companies to plant these trees and it will run campaigns like “wood is good” and “grow more wood - use more wood”, while reducing the rules that stop companies from cutting trees.
 Reduce natural and manmade threats to the forest by using technology, and survey all our plants and animals in the forests.
 
 * Launch a National Community Forest Management programme at a village level and get increased funds.
 
 * Create institutes to research and study the forests.
 
 * Study clashes between humans and animals to understand how it can stop such clashes and control strictly the trade of wild animals.
 
 * By building more zoos and nature parks that inspire people to conserve the environment."

 This Bill creates a set of rules that govern how your data can be used in India.
 
 It says that data can only be used once you understand why data is being collected, what it is used for and for how long the data will be stored; and give your permission. Data can be stored and processed, in some circumstances like emergencies and for the functioning of Government - without your permission.
 
 The Bill says that data such as your passwords, biometric data, transgender status, caste, tribe or sexual orientation – are “sensitive personal data”. This data requires additional permissions from you before it can be processed. Similarly, for children’s data there are additional rules and permissions, children’s data can’t be processed in a manner that harms them.
 
 Data Protection Bill: Your Rights
 
 After the bill becomes a law, you will have a few rights over your data.
 
 You have the right to find out if your data is being processed by a platform or if it has been processed in the past.
 
 You can correct any data you have shared or complete any incomplete information the platform may have about you.
 
 You can request that your data be transferred to another service provider. Further, in a few circumstances you can make a request for your data to be forgotten and not displayed.
 
 It is the responsibility of businesses to ensure that your data is secure and that they report any breach to the authorities. The bill also provides for data audits and impact assessment of businesses to be carried out.
 
 Data Protection Bill: Authorities and Penalties
 
 One copy of all data collected and processed will need to be stored on a server inside India, further, certain types of critical data – as decided by the Government, can only be stored on servers inside India. Data can be transferred outside India only if the authorities say transfers to a certain country are allowed or if a particular transfer is necessary.
 
 The Bill will create a Data Protection Authority and an Appellate Tribunal to ensure that the Bill is followed and data isn’t misused.
 
 If the Bill is not followed and data is misused, sold, disclosed etc. penalties can be levied on the data collector. These penalties are different for every offense, but can go up to 5 crore rupees or 2% of the company’s global turnover, whichever is higher – in certain cases.
 
 Bail will not be given if you are caught for an offence under this Act, and employees of companies and Government can also be penalized for not following the Bill."

The Policy encourages public private partnerships to achieve this aim.
 
 The policy wants to provide housing to citizens taking into consideration their cultural, climatic and habitat concerns. The role of the government is limited to that of a facilitator who promotes the participation of private entities.
 
 There will be four housing models of welfare, rental, rent to own and purchase, the last two models include lease based models and financing by certain financing institutions. The kinds of houses allowed could be multi-family, integrated townships, mixed land use comprising of residential, commercial, industrial and recreational areas and lastly mixed income housing or large scale housing catering to different income groups.
 
 The land for the housing facilities will be procured from government agencies, private agencies and land belonging to private agencies will be pooled for future development. The construction of the housing will be done by the owner themselves, government and private agencies and also through partnerships and co-operative societies.
 
 The policy clearly lays out modes of obtaining the capital and maintenance finance for such housing projects. NGOs and Governments will oversee the development of the projects and will address grievances of the citizens.
 
 The housing projects can be availed by end users living in Puducherry for at least five years. The policy will attempt to align the existing policies of the government with the current policy to avoid any confusion and extra-expenditure of resources. The plan will be reviewed once in three years and reset."
17/10/2018,31/12/2018,17/11/2018,Sports Broadcasting Signals (Mandatory Sharing with Prasar Bharati) (Amendment) Bill,https://mib.gov.in/sites/default/files/Noticedated17october2018onwebsite.pdf,harcharan.kaur@nic.in,Ministry of Information and Broadcasting,"The objective of the Sports Broadcasting Signals (Mandatory Sharing with Prasar Bharati) Act, 2007 (SBS Act, 2007) is to make sporting events of national importance (e.g. national cricket matches, Asian games, Commonwealth games) accessible to the largest number of viewers.
 
 The 2007 Act makes it mandatory for all private right holders (e.g. Star Sports Network, Sony Pictures Sports Network) to simultaneously share live broadcasting signals of such sporting events with Prasar Bharati, which is a public broadcasting agency. Prasar Bharati, which runs Doordarshan and All India Radio, can air the feeds that it gets from these private sports broadcasters only on its own terrestrial networks and DTH platform. Now, Section 8 of the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995 makes it mandatory for all cable operators to carry Doordarshan channels as notified by the government. Accordingly ‘DD National’ and ‘DD Sports’ have been notified as channels to be mandatorily carried by cable operators.
 
 A contradiction arises because according to the 2007 Act, Prasar Bharati can air the feeds only on Doordarshan’s terrestrial network and DTH platform and not on Doordarshan channels carried by cable and private DTH platforms. Therefore, viewers who have cable networks or private DTH networks can watch these events only on paid sports channels. To remedy this, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has proposed this amendment to Section 3(1) of the SBS Act, 2007 that will ensure that sporting events of national importance are not restricted to homes, which get Doordarshan network signals via its terrestrial or DTH networks. Homes which get Doordarshan on cable and private DTH networks would also get free access to live broadcast of these events."

The policy is applicable to all the upcoming residential as well as commercial buildings and will be monitored and reviewed by the Government every year. It gives incentives for both flat buyers and developers to encourage investment in green buildings.
 
 A green building is one that is energy efficient, uses less water, conserves natural resources, generates less waste and creates healthier living spaces for its occupants, in comparison to a conventional building. A green building can save water and energy between 30-50% and 20-30% respectively.
 
 Two agencies TERI-GRIHA and GBCI-LEED would rate the buildings, incentives will be given according to the building's rating.
 
 For developers, the incentives provided are in the form of tax refunds on development charges for construction of the green building. This is given when the developers secure a green building certificate
 
 For consumers, the incentive is a tax rebate on property tax for a period of 5 years - after receiving the Occupancy Certificate of a property with a Green Building certificate and rating.
 
 ***
 
 Developers can get a rebate on development charges upto 7.5% for constructing a green building and buyers can get a rebate upto 10% on property tax, depending on the rating of the building.
 
 To avail of the incentive, the developer has to share an expression of intent, and plans for the green building to an appointed agency. Thereafter, the agency will monitor the construction process to ensure it is built like a green building. Then these documents must be submitted to the concerned Municipal Corporation along with a self attested undertaking by the developer and the architects involved.
 
 On completion of the building, the authority will issue a 'Green Rating Certificate' if the construction was in accordance with the norms. In case the green rating certificate wasn't issued on completion of the project, a provisional certificate can be considered for award of incentives till a year of obtaining the occupation certificate.
 
 In case the project has a lower rating than that mentioned in the original declaration, there is a penalty of 200% along with the difference in the rebate to be paid by the builder to get the Occupation Certificate.
 
 Consumers don't need to follow any new procedure to avail the benefits of this policy."

More than one study has shown that firms and people show higher productivity in cities. For the lack of critical data to track the indicators of economic growth in a city, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) will appoint a team under Technical Assistance for Smart Cities (TASC) to conduct the following activities:

• Explore the availability of suitable data at the national, state and city level which can be used to estimate city level GDP.
• Develop a framework to estimate city level GDP based on available data sets.
• Estimate city GDP and adjust it suitably to reflect spatial productivity differences.

Policymakers will be able to use this data to plan for future infrastructure investments and raise finances for the same. The private sector will be able to use this data to complement public investment, strategize business decisions. They will also be empowered to identify ‘emerging city economies’ – i.e. future investment destinations, beyond the usual metropolitan suspects. Citizens may use this data to make migration decisions, and academicians and researchers will be able to exploit the data to undertake critical research in urban economics and planning."

The Draft Policy proposes to change the traditional 10+2 education system into:

• Foundation stage (three years of pre-primary school, followed by grade 1 and 2).
• Preparatory stage (grades 3,4 and 5). 
• Middle stage (grades 6,7 and 8).

The facility of free and compulsory education under the RTE has been extended from pre-school till class 12. Schools have to provide mid-day meals and there are provisions for nutritious breakfast for pre-school and primary school students. The Committee has also recommended teaching of Hindi, English and one regional language in the non-Hindi states and vice-versa for the Hindi-Speaking States. 

A four year integrated Stage-Specific B.Ed. programme will eventually be the minimum degree qualification for teachers. 

The Draft Policy suggests extending the Undergraduate Degree to four years instead of three years with a stage-wise exit system. The policy proposes restructuring of higher education Institutions to enable high quality research that meets global standards, as well as high quality teaching. There will be the formation of a National Research Foundation to create a research culture and capacity across institutions of higher education.These will be driven by two missions - Mission Nalanda and Mission Takshashila

The Rashtriya Shiksha Ayog will enable implementation of all educational initiatives and interventions, in addition to coordinating efforts between the Centre and the States. All private and public institutions will be treated on par and education will remain a non-profit activity. The draft policy suggests several new policy initiatives to create opportunities for distance learning; enhance the participation of under-represented groups; eliminate gender disparity and fulfil regional gaps in the education system.
